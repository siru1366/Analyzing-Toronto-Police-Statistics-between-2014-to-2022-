—It seems like you're trying to use list_package_resources to obtain information about a specific package from Open Data Toronto and then save that information to a CSV file using write_csv. However, there's a small misunderstanding in your code. The list_package_resources function returns a tibble/data frame with information about the resources associated with the specified package, not the actual data itself.
If you want to download a specific resource associated with the package, you should use the get_resource function to get the actual data. Here's an example:
# Acquire
police_resources <- list_package_resources("police-annual-statistical-report-arrested-and-charged-persons")
str(police_resources)
# Assuming you want to download the first resource, adjust accordingly
police_data <- get_resource(police_resources[1, ])
str(police_data)
# Save the data to a CSV file
write_csv(police_data, "inputs/data/crimes_data.csv")
Make sure to adjust the code according to your specific needs. This example assumes you want to download the first resource from the package. If you want a different resource, you may need to modify the index (police_resources[1, ]) accordingly.
Remember that the structure of the data may vary, and you might need to preprocess or filter it based on your analysis goals.
